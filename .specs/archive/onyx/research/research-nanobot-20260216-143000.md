# Research: Nanobot (HKUDS/nanobot)
<!-- Generated by /dig-into on 2026-02-16 -->

## Quick Summary
- **What**: Ultra-lightweight personal AI assistant framework delivering core agent functionality in ~4,000 lines of Python code—99% smaller than OpenClaw's 430,000+ lines [[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/HKUDS/nanobot)]
- **Why it matters**: Demonstrates that minimal, readable codebases can achieve full-featured AI agent capabilities while remaining fast (0.8s startup), resource-efficient (45MB memory), and developer-friendly for research and customization [[Analytics Vidhya](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2026/02/ai-crypto-tracker-with-nanobot/)]
- **Key insight**: Nanobot applies Unix philosophy to AI agents—doing one thing well—by building entirely around Model Context Protocol (MCP) as a "host" for other tools rather than embedding everything in a monolithic codebase [[Nanobot vs OpenClaw](https://juliangoldie.com/nanobot-vs-openclaw/)]

## Overview and Context

### Project Origins

Nanobot is an open-source project developed by the **Data Intelligence Lab@HKU** (HKUDS) at the University of Hong Kong, directed by **Dr. Chao Huang**, Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science & Institute of Data Science [[Data Intelligence Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/chaoh)]. Released on **February 1, 2026** [[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/HKUDS/nanobot)], the project emerged as a research-focused alternative to increasingly complex agent frameworks like OpenClaw.

The lab focuses on Large Language Models, Autonomous Agents, Graph Learning, Recommender Systems, and AI for Smart Cities [[Data Intelligence Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/chaoh)]. Dr. Huang has received the World's Top 2% Scientists award from Stanford University (2022-2025) and the lab's projects have accumulated over 77,000 GitHub stars across initiatives including LightRAG, RAG-Anything, DeepCode, and nanobot [[Google Scholar Profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Zkv9FqwAAAAJ&hl=en)].

### Reception and Growth

Within its first week, nanobot rapidly expanded from a minimal CLI agent to supporting 11 LLM providers and 8 chat platforms while maintaining ~3,500 lines of core code [[GitHub README](https://github.com/HKUDS/nanobot/blob/main/README.md)]. The project reached **20.2k GitHub stars** and **3k forks** within weeks of launch [[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/HKUDS/nanobot)], and achieved **10k stars within 4 days** [[GitHub Issue #209](https://github.com/HKUDS/nanobot/issues/209)].

Community reception on **Hacker News** highlighted enthusiasm for the project's minimal implementation and code quality, with users stating they "prefer Nanobot's minimal implementation with good code quality compared to understanding how OpenClaw worked" [[Hacker News Discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46897737)]. The project appeared on **GitHub Trending** and sparked comparisons with other lightweight alternatives like PicoClaw, NanoClaw, and ZeroClaw [[Threads Discussion](https://www.threads.com/@github.awesome/post/DURwUswkZvT/two-lightweight-alternatives-to-open-claw-showed-up-recently-nanobot-and-nano)].

### Licensing and Community

Nanobot is released under the **MIT License**, making it completely free and open source [[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/HKUDS/nanobot)]. The project actively welcomes community contributions, with 8 new contributors joining in recent releases [[GitHub README](https://github.com/HKUDS/nanobot/blob/main/README.md)]. A Discord community, WeChat groups, and Feishu groups provide support channels [[GitHub README](https://github.com/HKUDS/nanobot/blob/main/README.md)].

## Software Architecture

### Core Design Philosophy

Nanobot embodies the **Unix philosophy applied to AI agents: do one thing and do it well** [[Nanobot vs OpenClaw](https://juliangoldie.com/nanobot-vs-openclaw/)]. Rather than building a monolithic system, nanobot functions as an **ultra-lightweight CLI tool built entirely around the Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, designed to be a "host" for other tools [[SuperPrompt Blog](https://superprompt.com/blog/best-openclaw-alternatives-2026)].

The architecture emphasizes:
- **Clean, readable code** suitable for research modification and extension [[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/HKUDS/nanobot)]
- **Fast startup** (0.8 seconds) compared to heavier frameworks requiring 8-12 seconds [[Analytics Vidhya](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2026/02/ai-crypto-tracker-with-nanobot/)]
- **Low resource usage** (45MB memory vs 200-400MB for alternatives) [[Analytics Vidhya](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2026/02/ai-crypto-tracker-with-nanobot/)]
- **Research-ready** codebase with minimal moving parts for easier testing, refinement, and workflow expansion [[Sterlites Blog](https://sterlites.com/blog/picoclaw-paradigm-edge-intelligence)]

### Technical Stack

**Language Requirements:**
- **Python 3.11+** required [[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/HKUDS/nanobot)]
- Core agent code: **~3,668 lines** (verifiable via `bash core_agent_lines.sh`) [[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/HKUDS/nanobot)]

**Key Dependencies:**
- Model Context Protocol (MCP) support (added February 14, 2026) [[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/HKUDS/nanobot/releases)]
- WebSocket protocols for various communication channels [[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/HKUDS/nanobot)]
- Provider Registry system (`nanobot/providers/registry.py`) as single source of truth [[GitHub Discussion #431](https://github.com/HKUDS/nanobot/discussions/431)]

### Multi-Provider Architecture

**Supported LLM Providers (11 total):** [[GitHub README](https://github.com/HKUDS/nanobot/blob/main/README.md)]
- OpenRouter, Anthropic Claude, OpenAI, DeepSeek, Groq
- Gemini, MiniMax, Qwen, Moonshot, Zhipu
- Local vLLM deployment

Adding a new LLM provider requires only **2 simple steps** using the Provider Registry pattern—no if-elif chains to modify [[GitHub Discussion #431](https://github.com/HKUDS/nanobot/discussions/431)]. The architecture follows a **"batteries-included core + extensible ecosystem" model** where popular integrations (Telegram, OpenAI, Anthropic) remain built-in, while community contributions can be installed separately via `pip install nanobot-xxx` [[GitHub Discussion #431](https://github.com/HKUDS/nanobot/discussions/431)].

### Communication Channels

**Supported Platforms (8 total):** [[GitHub README](https://github.com/HKUDS/nanobot/blob/main/README.md)]
- Telegram, Discord, WhatsApp, Feishu
- Mochat, DingTalk, Slack, Email, QQ

Channels integrate through a **unified gateway architecture** with plugin interfaces [[DeepWiki Key Features](https://deepwiki.com/HKUDS/nanobot/1.2-key-features)].

### Plugin System

The architecture exposes three core plugin interfaces [[GitHub Discussion #431](https://github.com/HKUDS/nanobot/discussions/431)]:
1. **Channel Plugin API** (extracted from `BaseChannel`)
2. **Tool Plugin API** (extracted from `BaseTool`)
3. **LLMProvider Plugin API** (extracted from `LLMProvider`)

These interfaces serve as the "contract" for plugin developers, with plans to version interfaces and provide migration guides for breaking changes [[GitHub Discussion #431](https://github.com/HKUDS/nanobot/discussions/431)].

## How It Works

### Installation and Setup

**Installation Methods:** [[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/HKUDS/nanobot)]
1. **From source:** `git clone https://github.com/HKUDS/nanobot.git && cd nanobot && pip install -e .`
2. **UV tool:** `uv tool install nanobot-ai`
3. **PyPI:** `pip install nanobot-ai`

**Initial Configuration:**
1. Run `nanobot onboard` to initialize `~/.nanobot/config.json`
2. Set API keys for chosen LLM providers (e.g., OpenRouter)
3. Specify desired model (e.g., "anthropic/claude-opus-4-5")
4. Execute `nanobot agent` to begin interaction [[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/HKUDS/nanobot)]

### Core Capabilities

**Comprehensive Tool System** extending agent capabilities: [[DeepWiki Key Features](https://deepwiki.com/HKUDS/nanobot/1.2-key-features)]
- File operations (read, write, edit)
- Shell execution
- Web search integration
- Meta-capabilities for advanced workflows

**Advanced Features:** [[GitHub README](https://github.com/HKUDS/nanobot/blob/main/README.md)]

### Memory System

Nanobot maintains **both long-term and short-term memory** to provide context continuity across conversations [[DeepWiki Key Features](https://deepwiki.com/HKUDS/nanobot/1.2-key-features)]:
- **ContextBuilder** automatically includes memory context in system prompts
- Agents can explicitly update memory using file tools or through normal processing
- **Memory system redesigned** in recent updates with **interleaved chain-of-thought** for smarter multi-step reasoning [[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/HKUDS/nanobot/releases)]

### Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration

As of February 14, 2026, nanobot fully supports MCP [[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/HKUDS/nanobot/releases)]. The system functions as a **full MCP host** with conversational memory, autonomous reasoning, and rich UI rendering through MCP-UI [[Glama Blog](https://glama.ai/blog/2025-09-23-nanobot-by-obotai-architecting-real-mcp-agents-with-mcp-ui)].

**MCP Architecture Benefits:**
- Wraps existing MCP servers without requiring changes to core tools
- Simply add agent definitions, system prompts, and UI components on top of existing functionality
- Nanobots are exposed as MCP servers, allowing users to chat with them via any MCP client
- Full support for MCP tools, prompts, sampling, elicitation, and more [[Nanobot.ai](https://www.nanobot.ai/)]

## Trade-offs and Considerations

### Advantages

**Code Simplicity and Auditability**
- **99% smaller codebase** than OpenClaw (4,000 lines vs 430,000+) makes the entire system understandable in **~8 minutes** [[SuperPrompt Blog](https://superprompt.com/blog/best-openclaw-alternatives-2026)]
- Easier to audit for security concerns and modify for research purposes [[Sterlites Blog](https://sterlites.com/blog/picoclaw-paradigm-edge-intelligence)]
- Clean, readable code suitable for researchers modifying core memory or planning algorithms [[Sterlites Blog](https://sterlites.com/blog/picoclaw-paradigm-edge-intelligence)]

**Resource Efficiency**

- **191MB total memory footprint** makes it viable on Raspberry Pi or low-cost ARM boards [[Nanobot vs OpenClaw](https://juliangoldie.com/nanobot-vs-openclaw/)]
- Eliminates $6-24/month VPS costs—can run locally or on existing home server hardware [[Nanobot vs OpenClaw](https://juliangoldie.com/nanobot-vs-openclaw/)]

**Modularity and MCP-Centric Design**
- Built entirely around Model Context Protocol reduces coupling [[SuperPrompt Blog](https://superprompt.com/blog/best-openclaw-alternatives-2026)]
- Designed as a "host" rather than embedding everything in a monolith [[SuperPrompt Blog](https://superprompt.com/blog/best-openclaw-alternatives-2026)]
- Unified gateway architecture for communication channels [[DeepWiki Key Features](https://deepwiki.com/HKUDS/nanobot/1.2-key-features)]

### Disadvantages and Limitations

**Early Stage Maturity**
- Project launched February 1, 2026—relatively new compared to established frameworks [[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/HKUDS/nanobot)]
- Plugin SDK interfaces still being finalized (estimated v0.3-v0.4) with potential breaking changes [[GitHub Discussion #431](https://github.com/HKUDS/nanobot/discussions/431)]
- Community ecosystem still developing compared to mature alternatives [[GitHub Discussion #431](https://github.com/HKUDS/nanobot/discussions/431)]

**Feature Completeness**

## Practical Implementation Guidance

### Docker Deployment

**Docker Image Specifications:** [[DeepWiki Deployment](https://deepwiki.com/HKUDS/nanobot/8-deployment)]
- Base: `cgr.dev/chainguard/wolfi-base`
- Non-root user: `nanobot`
- Working directory: `/home/nanobot`
- Data volume: `/data` (persists session state, config, workflow files)
- Exposed port: `8080`
- Pre-installed tools: bash, git, curl, wget, jq, ripgrep, uv (Python package installer)

**Deployment Commands:**
```bash
# Initialize config
docker run -v ~/.nanobot:/root/.nanobot --rm nanobot onboard

# Edit config on host to add API keys, then run gateway
docker run -v ~/.nanobot:/root/.nanobot -p 18790:18790 nanobot gateway
```
[[DeepWiki Deployment](https://deepwiki.com/HKUDS/nanobot/8-deployment)]

**Multi-Platform Support:** Docker images available for multiple architectures [[DeepWiki Deployment](https://deepwiki.com/HKUDS/nanobot/8-deployment)]

### Security Configuration

**Production Hardening:**
- Set `"restrictToWorkspace": true` in config to sandbox the agent [[DeepWiki Deployment](https://deepwiki.com/HKUDS/nanobot/8-deployment)]
- Restricts all agent tools (shell, file read/write/edit, list) to workspace directory only
- Security hardening added in v0.1.3.post7 release [[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/HKUDS/nanobot/releases)]

### Configuration Management

**Config Location:** `~/.nanobot/config.json` [[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/HKUDS/nanobot)]

**Configuration Methods:** [[DeepWiki Deployment](https://deepwiki.com/HKUDS/nanobot/8-deployment)]
- Volume mount for Docker deployments
- Environment variables for containerized setups
- Direct file editing for local installations

### Adding Custom Providers

**Two-Step Process:** [[GitHub Discussion #431](https://github.com/HKUDS/nanobot/discussions/431)]
1. Implement provider interface conforming to `LLMProvider` base class
2. Register provider in `nanobot/providers/registry.py`

No complex if-elif chains required—registry acts as single source of truth.

## Common Pitfalls and Anti-Patterns

### Configuration and State Issues

**Problem: Stale API keys persist despite config updates** [[GitHub Issue #173](https://github.com/HKUDS/nanobot/issues/173)]
- **Symptom:** Nanobot reuses old API keys even after killing processes, updating config, and restarting
- **Root cause:** Cached state not properly invalidated
- **Workaround:** Completely delete `.nanobot` directory and reinitialize

### Scheduling and Timezone Problems

**Problem: Scheduled jobs fire at wrong times for non-UTC users** [[GitHub Issue #408](https://github.com/HKUDS/nanobot/issues/408)]
- **Symptom:** User in America/New_York sets reminder for 11:00 AM, job fires at 11:00 UTC (6:00 AM Eastern)
- **Root cause:** Scheduler interprets times as UTC regardless of user timezone
- **Solution:** Explicitly specify UTC times or wait for timezone-aware scheduling

### Model and Provider Quirks

**Problem: Double-prefixing with certain provider model names** [[GitHub Issue #404](https://github.com/HKUDS/nanobot/issues/404)]
- **Symptom:** Using Zhipu AI (Z-AI) model with `z-ai/` prefix through OpenRouter results in `zai/z-ai/...` double-prefix
- **Root cause:** Provider string manipulation logic doesn't handle prefixes correctly
- **Workaround:** Avoid prefixed model names or use alternative providers

**Problem: Cannot pass reasoning_effort to OpenAI reasoning models** [[GitHub Issue #408](https://github.com/HKUDS/nanobot/issues/408)]
- **Symptom:** OpenAI o1, o3, gpt-5-mini support `reasoning_effort` ("low"/"medium"/"high") but nanobot has no mechanism to pass it
- **Impact:** All calls use default effort level, missing potential quality/speed optimizations
- **Status:** Feature request pending

### File System and Path Handling

**Problem: Invalid brace-expansion directories created** [[GitHub Issue #29](https://github.com/HKUDS/nanobot/issues/29)]
- **Symptom:** Agent creates literal directories like `.nanobot/workspace/skills/google-calendar/{scripts,references,assets}`
- **Root cause:** Tool-generated filesystem paths created without validation, treating brace strings as literal directory names
- **Solution:** Validate and sanitize file paths before creation

### Gateway and Channel Stability

**Problem: Gateway not binding to declared port in Docker** [[GitHub Issue #510](https://github.com/HKUDS/nanobot/issues/510)]
- **Symptom:** Gateway prints "binding to port 18790" but doesn't actually bind
- **Environment:** Docker containers
- **Workaround:** Check container networking configuration, verify port mappings

**Problem: Gateway lifecycle can cause duplicate events and incomplete shutdown** [[GitHub Issue #379](https://github.com/HKUDS/nanobot/issues/379)]
- **Symptoms:** Multiple gateway processes running simultaneously, re-entrant channel startup, incomplete shutdown on non-KeyboardInterrupt exits
- **Impact:** Duplicate bot messages in channels like Feishu
- **Status:** Known architectural issue under investigation

## Follow-up Questions

1. **How does nanobot's MCP-centric architecture compare to traditional monolithic agent frameworks in terms of extensibility and maintenance burden over time?**

2. **What are the specific use cases where nanobot's lightweight design provides tangible advantages over feature-complete alternatives like OpenClaw, beyond just resource consumption?**

3. **How mature is the Plugin SDK roadmap (v0.3-v0.4), and what breaking changes should early adopters anticipate before interface stabilization?**

4. **What security auditing has been performed on the 4,000-line codebase, particularly around the sandbox mode ("restrictToWorkspace") and multi-channel integrations?**

5. **How does the Data Intelligence Lab@HKU plan to sustain nanobot development alongside their 10+ other active projects (LightRAG, DeepCode, etc.)?**

6. **What are the performance characteristics of nanobot when integrated with local vLLM deployments versus cloud provider APIs?**

7. **How does nanobot's memory system (long-term + short-term with interleaved chain-of-thought) compare to more established memory architectures in production agents?**

8. **What is the relationship (if any) between HKUDS/nanobot and nanobot-ai/nanobot (the separate MCP Agent Framework project at nanobot.ai)?**

9. **What lessons from nanobot's design philosophy could inform the development of other minimalist AI infrastructure projects?**

10. **How does the crowdfunding model ($7,500 raised via bags.app) relate to the project's MIT license and open-source sustainability?**
