# Allowed Hosts for Network Operations
# =====================================
# Hosts listed here bypass exfiltration warnings.
# The threat model: prompt injection tricking Claude into sending data
# to attacker-controlled servers. Internal hosts are not a realistic target.
#
# Supports:
#   - Exact match: "api.example.com"
#   - Wildcards: "*.ilude.com", "192.168.*"
#
# Private IP ranges (RFC1918) are allowed by default in the hook code,
# so you don't need to list them here unless you want to be explicit.

allowedHosts:
  # Trusted domains
  - "*.ilude.com"
  - "gitlab.prod.teams-sddc-dev.com"

  # Add additional trusted external hosts below:
  # - "api.mycompany.com"
  # - "*.internal.mycompany.com"
