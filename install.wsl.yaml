# WSL-specific dotbot configuration
# This config is designed to run inside WSL and link to configs from the
# Windows dotfiles repo mounted at /mnt/c/Users/<user>/.dotfiles
#
# KEY: ~/.dotfiles symlinks to the Windows mount so all paths work consistently
# (e.g., source ~/.dotfiles/zsh-plugins works in both Git Bash and WSL)

- defaults:
    link:
      relink: true
      force: true
      create: true

- clean: ['~']
