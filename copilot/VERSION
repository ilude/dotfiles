# Version History

## 1.0.0 - 2025-11-10

Initial release of the GitHub Copilot Instructions Template.

### Features

**Main Orchestration:**
- Comprehensive copilot-instructions.md with core philosophy
- Task failure rules and execution guidelines
- Code modification principles and workflow process

**Instruction Files:**
- Python standards (uv and traditional tooling)
- Dockerfile best practices (Alpine, multi-stage, security)
- DevContainer configuration (Docker-in-Docker, VS Code integration)
- Testing standards (pytest, fixtures, coverage)
- Makefile patterns (targets, variables, automation)
- Ignore files management (.gitignore, .dockerignore)
- Self-explanatory code commenting philosophy
- Copilot customization guidelines
- MCP services reference (optional)

**Prompt Files:**
- commit.prompt.md - Automated commit workflow
- check.prompt.md - Comprehensive quality checks
- test.prompt.md - Test execution and fixing
- lint.prompt.md - Code linting and style

### Source Projects

Consolidated best practices from:
- agent-spike (Python 3.14, uv, self-explanatory code)
- mentat-cli (CQRS, speckit workflow, IoC patterns)
- joyride-python (Docker, 12-Factor, BE BRIEF)
- onboard/attempt-one (modular, MCP services)
- onramp (service-oriented, meta-instructions)

### Key Principles

- Execute autonomously, don't ask permission
- Make minimal, surgical changes
- Always verify with tests before completion
- Be direct and concise in communication
- Code should be self-explanatory

### Customization Points

All files include customization notes:
- Language/framework-specific sections to add/remove
- Tool configuration (uv vs pip, ruff vs flake8)
- Project structure patterns
- Team-specific conventions
- CI/CD integration points

### Documentation

- Comprehensive README with quick start guide
- Usage examples for all prompts
- Troubleshooting section
- Best practices for maintenance
- Links to official documentation

## Future Versions

### Planned for 2.0.0
- Additional language support (TypeScript, Go, Rust)
- Framework-specific templates (React, FastAPI, Django)
- More prompt examples (refactor, deploy, review)
- Integration with popular CI/CD systems
- Video tutorials and examples

### Contributions Welcome
- Language/framework instruction files
- New prompt patterns
- Improved examples and documentation
- Bug fixes and clarifications
